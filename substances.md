# Herbs & Substances

## Determine Presence

To determine what substances are present in an area, roll on the below table and
consult the locale table below to modify the quality. Substances can take a
variety of forms: herbs, flowers, mushrooms, lichens, insects, and more.
Particularly rare substances should be more difficult to find or harvest.
Particularly desolate areas might have only one or two available notable
substances, while particularly verdant areas might have many.

## Find Substances

It is a trained intelligence task roll to find substances to harvest. Some
substances might be trivial to harvest, and others may require a task roll.
The referee should either consult their notes to determine what substances are
to be found in an area, or roll on the above tables to generate substances.
